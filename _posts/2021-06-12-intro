Disclaimer: This letter is written in a dire attempt to be humorous. Kindly do not attempt to reach out to me about how unrealistic you find my desires to be. It is okay to dream.

Dear Ms. Merkel,

My name is Khyathi Komalan, a sixteen year old who was unfortunately born in India. Before you judge me for my lack of patriotism, allow me to explain, contextually, why I dislike India as a nation, whilst attempting to convey how much I have admired Germany since my childhood. 

Growing up, my mother, who is a second world war aficionado, would often narrate me tales about the second world war. Like many others, I was more than perturbed by Anne Frank's diary, wherein she described her deepest feelings as she hid in a Secret Annex for over two years in Amsterdam. The sight of the weary eyes of my mother as she spent hours late at night watching holocaust movies is still etched into my mind, and is a prime memory of my childhood. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
