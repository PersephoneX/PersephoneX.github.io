An exhausted seven year old Khyathi plopped herself onto the bed after a long Saturday afternoon - she had just finished reading "Judy Moody and the Bad Luck Charm", after around four long hours. Her novice self, who was clueless about how many books were left to explore, thought that the series was the greatest she would ever read. While she probed into the depths of how Judy Moody's character learnt to believe in herself over the felicity offered by a squished penny, her mother joined her, and in the process, her train of thought was interrupted. Little did she know that this "tradition" of lying on the bed and discussing the most random of things would last for several years to come. Over the course of the conversation, Harry Potter was eventually brought into the picture, to be succinct, my curious mom wondered if there was any particular reason behind why I had not expressed any interest in reading the novels. A prime characteristic of my personality that is unique now, and even then, is the fact that I love to hold an opinion about everything, even if it is founded upon prejudice. At that point of time, I knew very little about Harry Potter, so I replied in a stereotypical and run-of-the-mill manner - my scoffing self told her that I was too old to read a book based on magic and fantasy. Thankfully, this was not met by contempt, and my opinion was respected, irrespective of how unfounded it was.

Fast-forward to sixth grade, I was introduced to a new environment with brighter peers than in the past. While I did spend the majority of fifth grade in the school library, I avoided the Harry Potter books like the plague. One of my classmates was an outspoken fellow (Mr. Blabbermouth) who was often subjected to jeering, which meant he was always on the lookout for an alternate target for people to ridicule in place of him. When he heard that I had not read Harry Potter yet, he deemed it unusual, and decided to spread the word. However, his closest acquaintace, who was also a friend of mine (Mr. Silent), decided to burst his bubble by stating that it was not abnormal at all - and the assertive tone was enough to convince Mr. Blabbermouth that he had targetted the wrong person. In spite of this outcome, I decided to begin reading the chronology on the next day, as the feminist in me was inquisitive about how successful J.K. Rowling was as a woman. As a chaotic person, I did not always have the habit of reading books in the order that they are intended to be read. This resulted in me checking out the last Harry Potter book from the library instead of the first one, which was humorous to Mr. Blabbermouth, who had read the entire series. On the other hand, Mr Silent, who was then reading the second book, offered to help me find "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", as he was sure that he had seen it in one of the shelves. Soon enough, I began reading the book at my own pace - I found it to be much better than I expected. I realised that my seven year old self had the wrong impression of Harry Potter, it wasn't some children's book that emphasized on unrealistic magic like a television show such as My Little Pony - it truly portrayed how the concept of superiority and inferiority could deepen the partitions present by default in a society, which in this case, was merely a school of witchcraft and wizardry. My heart went out to Hermione, a character that was initially portrayed to be a bossy and whiny martinet, who eventually turned out to be impressively rational and valiant. 

I waited until library period the following week to search for the next book - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Since Mr. Silent had just completed the same book, he told me to take it right after he gave it back to the librarian. After doing so, I took my seat at a nearby table, giving me the opportunity to overhear the laughter of Mr. Blabbermouth and Mr. Silent as Mr. Blabbermouth helped Mr. Silent search for the third book in the saga. Out of nowhere, I felt left out when it struck me that all of my acquaintances were ahead of me, and I decided to finish the book well before my next library class, so that I could return the book and pick the next one without having to wait. This brought some amount of peace to my excluded self - however, my line of reasoning was interrupted by Mr. Silent, who felt the necessity to inform me that he had found not one, but over ten copies of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the library. While I was amazed by that fact, my competitive nature led to me maintaining a cold disposure until I caught up with him. 

Much to Mr. Silent's dismay, he could not find a copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in the library that day. I ended up finishing the second Harry Potter book in the span of one day, as I was mesmerized by the progression of the plot. I remember being mesmirised when the book revealed that Ginevra Weasley was responsible for the cryptic writings on the walls of Hogwarts. 

As I had caught up with Mr. Silent, I was quite pleased with myself - but then, I wanted to read the subsequent book before him. Fortunately, I was able to find Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in the library, and I sneakily checked it out without informing Mr. Silent. I flaunted it in front of him, hoping to ellicit some sort of reaction from his behalf, but he seemed completely unbothered, and politely asked me to lend it to him if I complete it prior to the allocated library time. Once again, I finished the book in the short span of two days, and lent it to Mr. Silent. Instead of returning the book in my hands, he left it under his desk and asked his sister to tell me where it was, as he was apparently "too shy" to give it back. 

During the following library period, Mr. Silent found the fourth Harry Potter book before I did, and we made a similar deal which involved him lending the book to me as soon he was done with it. After completing the book, I was impatient to begin reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, so I brought it from Odyssey, as I had the opportunity to go there that weekend. Unfortunately, something else that accompanied that weekend was a power cut, which led to me reading nearly 800 pages in two days in the absence of light. When people ask me why I have poor eyesight now, I point to this moment. 

This unexpected turn of events led to me finishing one book before Mr. Silent, and I was elated to tell him the same on Monday morning. While he was a bit upset, he was determined to find the fifth book in the school library. During the library class, I found the sixth Harry Potter book, and began reading it, seating myself at a nearby table, only this time I did not feel ostracized in any way or form. Out of nowhere, Mr. Silent seized my right hand in order to grab my attention. He managed to find the last Harry Potter book published at that time, which was also the only book I had to read in order to complete the chronology. As I was not allowed to check out two books at once, he came up with the idea of hiding the book in a shelf with humongous academic textbooks, so no one would find it, and I could borrow it with ease after completing Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Little did he know that we would use this idea for many years to come.

My journey of completing the Harry Potter novels brought a great amount of contentment to me - not just because I adored the plot, and how J.K. Rowling threw light on the proletariat's troubles by means of a few books, but also since it gifted me with a great amount of treasured memories, mostly involving the time I spent with friends while reading it. I was so obsessed with Harry Potter that I would ask my father to buy me Prop Replicas from Platform 9 3/4 at London, and these collectibles continue to inundate my house.

Nevertheless, my love for J. K. Rowling was certainly not everlasting - today, at this point of time, the only thing that I am grateful for are the moments I spent with my friends. My respect for her did not just fade on one random day - all my affinity for her ebbed away eventually over a long course of time.
